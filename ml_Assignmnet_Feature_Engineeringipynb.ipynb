Examples include Gender, Country, Fruit Type, etc. Machine learning algorithms often require numerical input, so categorical variables need to be transformed into a suitable format for model training.\n",

        "Here are the common techniques used to handle categorical variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Label Encoding\n",
        "Label encoding involves converting each category in a categorical variable to a unique integer value. This technique assigns an integer to each category in the feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, for the Color feature with categories Red, Green, and Blue, the encoding might be:\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Red\" â†’ 0\n",

        "\"Green\" â†’ 1\n",

        "2. One-Hot Encoding\n",
        "One-hot encoding creates a binary column for each category in a categorical feature. For each row, the column corresponding to the category of the feature is set to 1, and the rest are set to 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, for the Color feature with categories Red, Green, and Blue, one-hot encoding creates three columns:\n",

        "\n",
        "Green â†’ [0, 1, 0]\n",
        "\n",
        "Blue â†’ [0, 0, 1]\n",

        "\n",
        "Drawback: Can result in high-dimensional data if there are many unique categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Ordinal Encoding\n",
        "Ordinal encoding is used when the categorical feature has an ordered relationship between its categories. Categories are assigned integer values based on their order.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, for the Education Level feature with categories High School, Bachelors, and Masters:\n",

        "Pros: Maintains the ordinal relationship between categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "Drawback: Can lead to misinterpretation if the data does not have a clear order.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Frequency / Count Encoding\n",
        "Frequency encoding assigns the frequency (or count) of each category as its value.\n",

        "For example, for the City feature with values New York, London, New York, London, and Tokyo:\n",

        "1. Understanding Data Distribution\n",
        "EDA helps you understand the distribution of variables, including both numerical and categorical features. Understanding how your data is distributed (e.g., normal, skewed) allows you to choose appropriate models and transformation techniques.\n",
